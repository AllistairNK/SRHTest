Masturbation is very ordinary - even young children have been known to engage in this behaviour. As the bodies of children mature, powerful sexual feelings begin to develop, and masturbation helps to release sexual tension. For adolescents, masturbation is a common way to explore their erotic potential, and this behaviour can continue throughout adult life. It usually starts by exposure to pornographic literature/video or self-experimentation or hearsay from peers. Usually, males stimulate the penis and female stimulate clitoris or vagina. The desire for masturbation is comparatively higher in men than women. It becomes a problem only when any one of the following is present 1. When a person becomes obsessed with it (causing addiction) 2. When it inhibits sex with the partner 3. When it is done in public 4. When it interferes with daily life activity or social life. 5. When there is a chance of causing harm/injury to the body 6. When there is the presence of irritated genitalia 7. When it causes psychological problems. Here are the tips to deal with addiction of masturbation: 1. Engage in physical activities like gym, sports, swimming, yoga, meditation, etc. 2. Take a break from the internet, mobile and computer. Gradually increase the duration of this break. 4. Religious or spiritual involvement can significantly help. Especially, before going to bed for sleep, offer a prayer to god. 5. Consider masturbation without the use of pornography. Consider even deleting all the pornographic material and staying away from the friends who deliver it to you. 6. Avoid being in alone, try to stay with groups or family as much as you can. 7. Discuss it with your friends or can even take a help from professionals",

          "context": "Abusive language or insults refer to derogatory, offensive, or disrespectful words used to attack or belittle someone, often with the intention of causing harm or distress. It can include name-calling, slurs, profanity, mocking, or demeaning remarks about a person's appearance, intelligence, abilities, or character. Abusive language aims to undermine a person's self-esteem, provoke emotional pain, or assert power and control over them. People may insult others due to insecurities, a desire for power or control, anger or frustration, projection of their own negative traits, group dynamics, a lack of empathy, or learned behaviour. However, insulting behaviour is not justified, as it can cause emotional harm and contribute to a toxic environment. Using abusive language can be a form of verbal abuse. Verbal abuse involves the use of words, tone, or language that is intended to harm, control, or demean another person. Abusive language can cause emotional pain, damage self-esteem, and create a hostile and unhealthy dynamic in relationships. While verbal abuse can take various forms beyond just using abusive language, the use of derogatory or offensive words can be a significant aspect of verbal abuse. It is important to recognize and address abusive language in order to promote healthy and respectful communication. Calling names (using abusive language/insults) are common during adolescence. Here are some tips, you may select any one according to your comfort: ignorance can be a bless. Avoid interacting or looking toward the teasers direction. 2. Be calm and dont respond as eventually teasers will lose interest and will stop. 3. Turn the tables by confronting the teaser with confidence. 4. Ask for help if needed then approach your parents, teachers, friends, etc. If a spouse/partner enjoys verbally abusing their partner, it can lead to significant negative consequences. These may include emotional and psychological harm to the victim, breakdown of communication, erosion of trust and intimacy, impact on children and family, perpetuation of an abusive cycle, social isolation, and potential physical health effects. It is important to seek help and support to address this behaviour, promote healthier communication, and ensure the safety and well-being of everyone involved. Yes, verbal abuse within a marriage can be a valid reason for considering the dissolution of the relationship. Continuous verbal abuse can erode the foundation of trust, respect, and emotional well-being necessary for a healthy and fulfilling partnership. In some cases, the abusive behaviour may persist despite efforts to address it, and in such situations, ending the marriage may be the best option for the victim's safety and overall well-being. It is important to prioritize one's own mental and emotional health and seek support from professionals, such as therapists or counsellors, who can provide guidance and assistance in navigating this difficult situation.",

          "context": "Informally, a crush is a sort of attraction for a person, whether for looks, intelligence, skills, or anything else. When you have a crush on someone, it means that you find that person very attractive or that you have a strong desire for that person. Eventually, it may grow into love, or it may diminish in time. People often perceive a crush as an infatuation. Idolize refers to the act of regarding someone with great admiration, reverence, or devotion. When you idolize someone, you place them on a pedestal and perceive them as an ideal or perfect figure. It involves looking up to someone with a high degree of admiration, often for their qualities, achievements, or perceived greatness. Idolizing someone can involve strong emotional attachment and a tendency to overlook or minimize their flaws or shortcomings. It is important to maintain a balanced perspective when idolizing someone and to recognize their humanity, acknowledging that no one is perfect. The differences between crush and idolise are crushes are usually temporary infatuations or attractions, idolizing someone involves a more intense and long-lasting admiration, often regarding them as an ideal or perfect figure. Having a crush on someone or idolizing them can be okay as long as it is done in a healthy and balanced manner. It is natural to feel attracted to someone's qualities, talents, or achievements and to admire them. However, it's important to remember that everyone is human and has flaws. It's crucial to maintain realistic expectations and avoid putting someone on a pedestal or idealizing them to an unrealistic extent. It's also important to respect the boundaries and consent of the person you have a crush on or idolize, and to remember that they are entitled to their own autonomy and personal space. Healthy admiration and attraction should not interfere with your own self-worth or lead to unhealthy or obsessive behaviours.",

          "context": "A break-up is the ending of a romantic relationship, often due to incompatibility, differences in values, or conflicts. It can be emotionally challenging, involving emotions like sadness, anger, confusion, or relief. Communication is crucial during a break-up, and individuals may choose to take time for self-reflection, self-care, and personal growth. Seeking support from friends, family, or counsellors can help navigate the emotional aftermath. Over time, individuals may heal and move forward, opening themselves up to new possibilities and future relationships. Break-ups happen due to reasons such as incompatibility, loss of connection, lack of communication or trust, unresolved issues or conflicts, different life paths, and in cases of abuse or toxicity. They occur when the relationship is no longer fulfilling, healthy, or aligned with the individuals' needs and goals. Rejection refers to the act of refusing or dismissing someone or something. It involves denying acceptance, approval, or participation. Rejection can evoke feelings of disappointment, hurt, or exclusion. It is a normal part of life and can occur in various contexts, such as relationships, job applications, or social situations. Dealing with rejection requires resilience, self-reflection, and the understanding that it does not define one's worth or potential for future success. Everyone has a different coping mechanism. If a method works for somebody, that doesnt mean it may work for you. Here are some ways to deal with it - 1. Try to deal with it maturely. A person is very vulnerable to addiction, depression, suicide, etc. We must understand that these things are temporary. You must think about your career, parents, and friends. Appreciate the things what you currently have in life. Dont take any steps in the heat of the moment. 2. Talk about it with friends or family, a support is needed. 3.

Try to look at the positive side of it and every failure is new learning. 7. If needed then, dont be scared to take professional help. Remember that time is the best healer, with time everything heals. Love is not about gaining always, its also about letting the person go. Somethings are not in your control.",

What you must understand is that each person is unique and special. We must keep a positive attitude towards ourselves. We also must make sure to never body shame any person; this is wrong. Body shaming is the act of criticizing or mocking someone's physical appearance, size, shape, or weight, which can lead to negative self-esteem and body image issues. Body image is the view towards ones bodyhow one perceives ones body and appearance. Self-esteem is how one thinks about oneself and how much one values oneself. Yes, there is a lot of difference in the sequence and the rate of growth of physical growth (puberty) of males and females. Even among people of the same sex, there could be a difference. As growth depends on sex (male or female), genes, nutrition, and other environmental factors. As everybody is unique and different.",

          "context": "Maintaining female genital hygiene is important for overall health and well-being. Here are some general guidelines for maintaining good female genital hygiene: cleanliness: wash the external genital area (vulva) with mild, unscented soap and warm water. Avoid using harsh soaps, douches, or perfumed products as they can disrupt the natural balance of the vagina and potentially cause irritation or infection. Remember to rinse thoroughly and pat dry with a clean towel. Proper wiping technique: when using the toilet, always wipe from front to back after urination or bowel movements. This helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anal area to the vagina, reducing the risk of urinary tract infections and other infections. Menstrual hygiene: change sanitary pads, tampons, or menstrual cups regularly during menstruation to maintain cleanliness and prevent odor. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper use and disposal. Avoid tight-fitting underwear and clothing: wear breathable cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothing to allow air circulation and reduce moisture build-up, which can contribute to bacterial growth and infections. Practice safe sexual habits: if engaging in sexual activity, practice safe sex by using condoms and getting regular sexual health check-ups. It's also important to communicate openly with your partner about sexual health and any concerns. Regular check-ups: schedule regular visits with a healthcare provider for gynaecological exams, screenings, and to address any concerns or questions you may have regarding your genital health. Remember, every individual is unique, and it's important to listen to your body and seek medical advice if you experience any unusual symptoms, discomfort, or changes in your genital area. The vagina is a self-cleaning organ and has a delicate balance of natural bacteria and ph levels that help maintain its health. It is generally not recommended to put water or wash the inside of the vagina for the following reasons: disruption of natural balance: flushing water or using douches inside the vagina can disturb the natural balance of bacteria and ph levels, leading to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria or an imbalance known as bacterial vaginosis. This can result in vaginal odor, itching, irritation, or an increased risk of infections. Increased risk of infection: the vagina has a self-cleaning mechanism that naturally removes dead cells and discharge. Introducing water or other substances can disrupt this natural process and create an environment more susceptible to infections, including yeast infections or urinary tract infections. Irritation and drying: water, especially if it contains chemicals like soaps or shampoos, can irritate the sensitive vaginal tissues and cause dryness, itching, or discomfort. It's important to note that maintaining hygiene of the external genital area (vulva) is sufficient for daily cleanliness. Washing the vulva with mild, unscented soap and water is recommended, while avoiding harsh soaps or douches. If you have specific concerns about vaginal hygiene or notice any unusual symptoms, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider who can provide personalized advice and guidance.",

          "context": "Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin (prepuce) of the penis through a surgical procedure. It is commonly practised in certain religions, like muslims and jews, during early childhood. It can also be done for some medical conditions like phimosis, hypospadias, etc. Research studies show that circumcision at an early age is protective against infections, penile cancer, and phimosis, and it doesnt affect sexual function or pleasure. However, it may have risks of surgical complications. The foreskin of the penis is non-retractable before 4-6 years of age; in certain cases, it may be up to 810 years. This is because the glans penis and foreskin are attached together by a layer that dissolves after a certain age. This is called physiological phimosis. Before this age, the foreskin of the penis shouldnt be retracted, as it can cause damage or injure the penis. There is no objective data to suggest that having a physiological phimosis leads to a pathological phimosis at a later stage. In adults, the prepuce is often retracted back during peeing (urination) or while cleaning the penis (while taking a bath). No, it wont intervene during the sexual intercourse. As during the sexual intercourse, prepuce is retracted back in an uncircumcised penis. Glans penis is the most sensitive part for the sexual stimulation. Direct stimulation over the glans penis in a fully lubricated vagina doesnt causes pain. In adults with an uncircumcised penis, the penis should be cleaned by retracting the prepuce (over the glans) with plain, simple water. As under the prepuce, a white colour material called smegma is deposited. Smegma is made up of dead tissues and mucin content. Smegma protects and lubricates the glans and inner lamella of the prepuce, facilitating erection, preputial eversion, and penetration during sexual intercourse. Smegma also contains lytic materials (such as lysozyme), which probably originate from the prostate, and seminal vesicles, which destroy bacterial cell walls. It also inhibits and destroys candida species (fungal microbes). If the smegma is not cleaned, then it may harden into smegma stones in men, as seen with extremely poor hygienic habits. If smegma is over-cleaned (very frequently cleaned), then a person can become susceptible to a penile candida infection. Therefore, the cleaning of smegma should be adequately done (maybe 2-3 times a week). The decision to circumcise the penis is a personal and cultural choice that varies across different regions and religions. It is not universally recommended or required. Some potential benefits include improved hygiene, reduced risk of certain infections (such as urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted infections like hiv), and a lower risk of penile cancer. However, these benefits are generally modest, and the overall impact on health is relatively small. On the other hand, circumcision is a surgical procedure that carries potential risks and complications, such as bleeding, infection, pain, and damage to the penis. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide information, guidance, and support in making an informed decision about circumcision.",

          "context": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, both in developed and developing countries. It is more common in the 30s. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the breast cells. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and divide uncontrollably, forming a tumour. Breast cancer can affect both women and men, although it is more common in women. The risk factors for breast cancer are positive family history (genetics), prolonged exposure to endogenous oestrogen (such as early menarche, late menopause, and late age at first childbirth), exogenous hormones, radiation, alcohol use, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. Symptoms of breast cancer can vary, but common signs include a lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area, changes in breast size or shape, nipple changes or discharge, and skin changes like dimpling or redness. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving the prognosis of breast cancer. Regular self-examination of the breasts and screening methods such as mammograms, clinical breast exams, and breast ultrasounds can help detect abnormalities or signs of cancer. If a suspicious lump or other symptoms are detected, further diagnostic tests such as a biopsy may be performed to confirm the presence of breast cancer. Treatment options for breast cancer depend on various factors, including the stage of cancer, its characteristics, and individual health considerations. Treatment may involve surgery (such as lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these approaches. To prevent breast cancer: maintain a healthy weight. Limit alcohol consumption. Stay physically active. Consider breastfeeding if possible. Avoid or limit hormone therapy. Know your family history and seek appropriate screenings. Perform regular breast self-exams. Attend recommended screenings. Remember, prevention strategies can help reduce the risk but do not guarantee complete prevention. Regular check-ups and discussions with healthcare professionals are important.",

Look at the regions marked 'c' and 't' on the test card. 'c' indicates a control. This band must always appear because this is the comparison band. 't' indicates the test sample. 2. If only one pink or purple band appears in the region marked 'c', it means that the test is negative for pregnancy. 3. If two pink or purple bands appear, one in the region marked 'c' and the other in the region marked 't', it means that the test is positive for pregnancy 4. In case no bands appear, then the test is invalid. Repeat the test with a new pack of urine pregnancy tests after 72 hours. 5. If the line formed in region 't' is faint, this could be due to low levels of hcg hormone. It is said that it is weakly positive, but it is better to repeat the test with a new pack card after 72 hours. A woman can become pregnant if she is having unprotected sexual intercourse after delivery of the baby (during the post-partum period). In other words, it is possible to become pregnant very soon after having a baby. Using a birth control method in the weeks after having a baby (during the postpartum period) helps to avoid an unintended pregnancy. The average weight gain in pregnancy is around 11kg. 1kg in the 1st trimester, 5 kg in the 2nd trimester, and 5kg in the 3rd trimester. Ideally, total weight gain should be according to bmi (weight measured before pregnancy). Abnormal weight gain is >500g in a week or more than 2.2 kg in a month. The ideal total weight gain should be according to bmi (weight measured before pregnancy). Consult a doctor if you suspect something abnormal.",

Abstinence from sex especially during the fertile period (10th to 17th days of the menstrual cycle) 2. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus (the male partner withdraws his penis from the vagina just before ejaculation) 3. Lactational amenorrhea is a method because ovulation is absent post the delivery of baby (maximum till first 6 months), if the baby is regularly breastfed. Temporary. Method: 1. Barrier methods like condoms (male condom), femidom (female condom), diaphragms, cervical caps, and vaults 2. Intra uterine devices (iuds) like copper-t 3. Injectables implants, 4. Injections (dmpa) 5. Oral contraceptive pills (ocp) which it also has many benefits and commonly used in the treatment of menstrual abnormalities. Permanent methods: 1. Vasectomy (vas deferens is cut in males). It is simpler and easier than tubectomy. 2. Tubectomy (fallopian tubes is cut in females). However, natural methods have higher chances of failure compared to the temporary and permanent methods. Vasectomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting or blocking the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethra. It is a form of permanent contraception for men, as it prevents sperm from reaching the semen ejaculated during sexual intercourse. After a vasectomy, men typically continue to produce sperm, but the sperm are absorbed by the body instead of being ejaculated. The testicles still produce hormones, including testosterone, so there is usually no change in sexual desire, performance, or the ability to achieve an erection. It's important to note that vasectomy is intended to be a permanent form of contraception, and while reversal procedures are available, they are not always successful. Therefore, it is recommended that men consider vasectomy as a permanent decision and carefully discuss the procedure with a healthcare professional to fully understand the implications and alternatives. Emergency contraception is not a regular method of birth control. Its only can be used after unprotected sexual intercourse, or if the birth control method failed (such as if a condom broke). 1. Copper iudwomen can have the copper-t iud inserted within five days of unprotected sex. 2. Emergency contraceptive pillswomen can take emergency contraceptive pills up to 3 to 5 days after unprotected sex. The sooner the pills are taken, the better they will work. They can be availed in the pharmacy or general stores in the name of ezy pill, i-pill, unwanted 72, plan-b, morning after, etc. Frequent use of emergency pills should be avoided as they can hamper menstrual cycles and cause hormonal imbalance. If there is a frequent need for emergency pills, then one needs to shift to other contraceptive methods like oral contraceptive pills (ocp), intrauterine devices (iucd) like copper t or injectable contraceptives. Please consult your doctor for contraceptive plan. If you or someone you know has been raped or sexually assaulted, you should report it to the police immediately.",

The causes of pms are not completely clear. But it is thought that hormonal fluctuations during a womans monthly cycle play a role. Many women experience breast tenderness and abdominal pain, for instance. Other symptoms include headaches, back pain and joint or muscle ache. Water retention, sleep problems or digestion problems, skin blemishes and food cravings may occur too. Women who have pms often feel exhausted, insecure, down, listless, irritable, or angry in the days leading up to their period. Some have problems concentrating and experience mood swings. They might feel like they are losing control over their body and emotions. Severe pms can really affect everyday life and relationships with friends, family, partners, and colleagues. To deal with pms: get enough exercise and sports use relaxation techniques and meditating do not smoke drink less alcohol and caffeine eat less salt medications can be also used for severe pms symptoms, feel free to consult a doctor.",

          "context": "Hernia is the bulging out of the abdomen's contents through a small defect in the muscle or tissue. It could occur in the abdomen or in the groin (inguinal). A groyne hernia is more common in males. It could be present since birth (congenital) or after any abdominal surgery (incisional). The risk factors are old age, obesity, collagen vascular disorder, illness increasing the abdomen pressure (chronic constipation or cough), and weightlifting. People with hernia complaints of a bulging mass in the abdomen or in the groin (e. G. , swelling in the scrotum) with dull or dragging pain. They are reducible in size (by manual manipulation or by lying down) in the initial stages. In the later stage (strangulation of the content), it can become irreducible with severe pain and may need emergency surgery. Medicines don't play any role in hernia treatment. Hernias need to be surgically operated on for treatment. Hydrocele is a swelling in the scrotum (around the testes) due to the accumulation of fluid. It could be due to infections or congenital defects, which are associated with groin hernias, trauma, and tumours. Treatment depends on the age and cause of the hydrocele. Hydroceles can develop in males of all ages, from newborns to adults. In infants, hydroceles often resolve on their own within the first year of life. However, in older boys and men, hydroceles may persist and require medical intervention. The main symptom of a hydrocele is the enlargement of the scrotum, which may appear swollen or filled with fluid. The size of the hydrocele can vary, ranging from small and barely noticeable to large and causing discomfort. Hydroceles are usually painless, but they may cause some discomfort or a heavy feeling in the scrotum. In infants, hydroceles often resolve without treatment. However, if a hydrocele persists or causes discomfort in older individuals, medical intervention may be necessary. Treatment options for hydroceles include watchful waiting, aspiration (draining of the fluid with a needle), or surgical repair (hydrocelectomy) to remove or correct the underlying cause of the hydrocele.",

          "context": "Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. Various strains of the human papillomavirus (hpv), a sexually transmitted infection, play a role in causing most cervical cancers. Risk factors for cervical cancer are human papillomavirus (hpv), poor immune status (hiv), co-infection with other stds, tobacco smoking, young age at first baby birth, and multiple sexual partners. The symptoms of cervical cancer can vary, and in the early stages, there may be no noticeable signs. However, as the cancer progresses, the following symptoms may occur: abnormal vaginal bleeding: this includes bleeding between periods, after sexual intercourse, or after menopause. It may also involve unusually heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding. Unusual vaginal discharge: cervical cancer can cause a watery, bloody, or foul-smelling discharge that may be persistent. Pelvic pain: persistent pain in the pelvic area, including pain during sexual intercourse or pelvic examinations, can be a symptom of cervical cancer. Painful urination: some women with cervical cancer may experience pain or discomfort during urination. Back or leg pain: as the cancer progresses, it may spread to nearby tissues and organs, leading to back or leg pain. It's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by conditions other than cervical cancer. If you experience any of these symptoms or have concerns, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and appropriate testing. Regular cervical cancer screenings, such as pap smears and hpv tests, are essential for early detection and prevention. Prevention from cervical cancer: primary prevention begins with hpv vaccination of girls aged 9-14 years (before they become sexually active). Avoid smoking or tobacco in any form. Safe sex practices like use of condoms. Avoid multiple sexual partners. Prolapse of the uterus is the descent of the uterus into or outside the vagina. It happens due to weak pelvic muscles and ligaments, which can result in problems during urination and defecation. The causes and risk factors for the weakening of pelvic muscles and ligaments are: 1. Trauma during childbirth (delivery), 2. Multiple pregnancies, 3. Smoking, 4. Old age, 5. Increased abdomen pressure condition (chronic cough, constipation). However, it can be managed conservatively (with pessaries or pelvic floor training) or with surgeries. Symptoms of uterine prolapse can include; a sensation of heaviness or pulling in the pelvis. Vaginal discomfort or pain. A protrusion or bulge felt in the vaginal area. Problems with urination, such as urine leakage or difficulty emptying the bladder. Bowel movement difficulties or constipation. Sexual difficulties or discomfort. Treatment for uterine prolapse depends on the severity of the condition and the individual's symptoms. Non-surgical approaches may include pelvic floor exercises (kegel exercises), pessary insertion (a device placed in the vagina to support the uterus), and lifestyle modifications. In more severe cases or when conservative measures fail, surgical intervention may be necessary to repair or remove the prolapsed uterus.",

          "context": "Yes, it is normal to have pubic hair. Pubic hair is a natural and normal part of human development, particularly during puberty. The presence of pubic hair is a sign of sexual maturity and is influenced by hormonal changes in the body. The growth of pubic hair varies among individuals in terms of thickness, colour, and distribution. Some people have sparse or fine pubic hair, while others have thicker or coarser hair. The amount and pattern of pubic hair can also differ between males and females. It's important to remember that everyone's body is unique, and there is a wide range of normal variations when it comes to pubic hair. It is a personal and individual characteristic, and there is no standard or \"normal\" appearance. Ultimately, whether to groom or remove pubic hair is a personal preference and should be based on individual comfort and preferences. Pubic hair removal is a more recent thing but increasingly common grooming practise and shows a great range of variability between different populations. Although carried out by both males and females. It is always a personal choice of a person to remove pubic hair or not. Numerous reasons exist for removing pubic hair, including hygiene, comfort, aesthetic reasons, sex appeal, for oral sex, genitals may look bigger and clean, medical reasons (like a fungal infection, pubic lice infestation, before surgery, etc). A multi-billion-dollar industry has developed around the numerous methods and products available for hair removal. Products and techniques are available include shaving (the most common method is performed with a razor/electric razor), trimmer, waxing, threading/plucking, trimming with scissors, hair removal cream, sugaring (use all-natural paste or gel), dyeing/bleaching, electrolysis, and laser. Pubic hair removal can result in adverse health events, depending on the method used. These complications can include ingrown hair, cuts, injuries, epidermal abrasion, folliculitis, vulvitis, or contact dermatitis. In more serious cases, genital burns can occur from waxing, and severe skin irritation from various products can lead to vaginal irritation or post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The axillae are uniquely characterised by the presence of hair follicles and sweat glands. These glands secrete a clear, odourless substance, consisting primarily of water and salts. The process of body odour formation in the axillae was found to depend on the biotransformation of these odourless secretions into volatile odoriferous substances by commensal bacteria (corynebacterial or staphylococci) on the skin and hair surfaces. Body odour, in particular axillary odour, is perceived as unpleasant by most cultures worldwide. Moreover, excessive sweating and the resulting unpleasant odour are reported to adversely affect self-confidence and self-esteem in both men and women. Reducing or eliminating body odour is an essential goal of many people's daily personal care routine. Worldwide.

          "context": "Acne during puberty is normal. As it typically starts at puberty and resolves slowly as the person reaches his or her 20s. Acne is a condition of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin. Blockage of the sebaceous glands and colonisation with bacteria (propionibacterium acnes) lead to acne. Acne can have multiple causes, like genetic factors, stress, androgens, drugs, and excess sweating. They can also occur in medical conditions like polycystic ovary disease (pcod) in females, etc. The symptoms and severity of acne can vary, ranging from mild breakouts to more severe and persistent forms. Acne can have both physical and emotional impacts, as it may cause discomfort, pain, scarring, and affect self-esteem. Treatment options for acne include over-the-counter topical creams, gels, or cleansers containing ingredients like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. In more severe cases, prescription medications such as antibiotics, retinoids, or hormonal therapy may be necessary. It is advisable to consult with a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to individual needs. Maintaining a regular skincare routine, avoiding excessive oil-based products, keeping the skin clean, and avoiding picking or squeezing acne lesions can help manage and prevent further breakouts. No, masturbation doesnt have any effect on acne.",

Wash the genital area from outside with plain water (no soap) after each use of toilet or urination. 7. Keep the area between legs dry, otherwise chaffing or soaring may develop. 8. Eat a healthy diet, iron-rich diet like green leafy vegetables. 9. Always carry an extra sanitary napkin with you, whenever going out. 10. After using the sanitary napkin (pad), wrap it in paper and dispose of in a closed lid dustbin. Never dispose of the sanitary pad in an open place or in the toilet. 11. Exercise can help in relieving the symptoms like premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea and relieve bloating. Exercise also causes the release of serotonin, making one feel much happier. 12. If feeling tired then rest can be taken. Drink adequate water and be hydrated. 13. A heating pad or hot water fomentation can be applied over the abdomen (tummy) to relive the pain or cramps. For cramps and back pain, simple painkillers like paracetamol, mefenamic acid can also be taken. 14. Maintain a calendar/diary, so you are prepared for the next cycle. The steps to using a sanitary pad are: 1. Choose a pad of the appropriate thickness, absorbency, shape, and style. There are two types of pads that can be chosen: with and without wings. \"wings\" are those sticky little pieces that adhere to your underwear. They keep your pad from lodging to the side and feel like a diaper. In short, unless they irritate your skin or something, they're your friend. \"avoid scented pads\". 2. Get in position. It'll be easiest if you're sitting down, and your undies are around your knees. Standing is fine, too; you just want everything within arm's reach. 3. Remove any wrappers or boxes from the pad. 4. Fold out the flaps, or wings, and take off the long, centre backing that covers the adhesive in the centre. Expose the adhesive on the wings too. 5. Stick the adhesive part to your panties. You want the pad to be directly beneath your vagina. 6. Wear the panties as usual. Done! \"if your pad is itchy or irritating your skin at all, remove it and use a different kind of pad. 7. Make sure to wash your hands before and after changing the pad.",

          "context": "Sexual intercourse, or a sexual act (most people call it \"sex), is usually performed between two mature adults with consent who are legally married or in a romantic relationship. It can be divided into coitus and non-coital sex. Coitus sex is the penile insertion into the females vagina. Non-coital sex is hugging, kissing (cheek, body, or on the mouth), touching, stimulating, and masturbation. Sexual intercourse is a natural biological function like respiration, eating and defecation. Healthy individuals have sex for reproduction or pleasure or for body need. You dont have to do anything if you dont want to have sex. Sex is something that is enjoyed only if it is done out of free will. Right now, it might seem quite strange to you, but later you might change your mind. Thats ok. Sex is a way of expressing ourselves and our feelings. It is not dirty or wicked. Sexual consent is an agreement to participate in sexual activity. It could be verbal (communicated) or in written form. Consent is never in the form of physical gestures, body signs, objects, indirect signals, actions, dress, etc. Consent is never implied based on past behaviour, activity, or dress. Valid consent is consent without any pressure or threat, without any influence of drugs or alcohol. Consent is always reversible at any point in time, and it must be very specific for every step or activity. Consent is required before every sexual act in life, even if you are a married couple or your partner is a sex worker. A sexual act without consent is always wrong and considered rape, which is a punishable crime. Everyone has the right to be in control of what they will and will not do with their bodies. Consent is a very important thing for a healthy, pleasurable relationship and consensual sexual behaviour with a partner. Consent should be actively communicated and recognised by their partners. If you have sex when you are ready for it with someone you care about and who cares about you, it feels good in your body and in your mind. But if you are scared, unwilling, or not ready for it, it may be the worst experience. Doing any sexual act because of pressure from someone else can have sex feel quite horrible. People describe sex as excited, warm, tingly, thrilled, pleasurable, gentle, loved, wanted, special, and happy. All societies accept sex between two lawfully married adults as safe and normal. Sex is a personal thing that is always done in private and with the consent of the partner. It should never be forced. A person can always freely choose when he or she wants to have sex. It also depends on cultural, religious, and personal moral values. Most people wait for the correct time when they are emotionally, mentally, and physically mature enough.",

          "context": "Chromosomes decide whether the baby will be a girl or a boy. Women have only one type of chromosome which is x chromosome in the ovum. However, men have two types of chromosomes which are x and y chromosomes. So, if a sperm with an x chromosome fertilises the egg (which has x chromosomes), the baby will be a girl. If a sperm with the y chromosome fertilises the egg, the baby will be a boy\". No one can control or decide which sperm will meet the x chromosome of the female ovum. Twins are two babies born in a single pregnancy. They could be identical (lookalikes) or non-identical twins. The identical twins are formed through the division of one fertilised ovum or egg (zygote) into two; thats why they are scientifically also called \"monozygotic twins\". Non-identical twins are formed due to the fertilisation of two separate ovum or eggs with two sperm; they are also called zygotic twins (fraternal twins). A girl who has started having her periods can become pregnant if semen enters her vagina. Also, if a girl has not yet begun to get her periods but will start having them from that month onwards, she can become pregnant if semen enters her vagina. No, kissing doesn't lead to creating babies. No, a girl can't become pregnant if semen is ejaculated outside the vagina (nearby the vulva or groin), unless semen (which contains sperm) is ejaculated inside the vagina. However, pre-ejaculatory secretions from the penis, which are released during sexual intercourse for lubrication, may contain some sperm, which can lead to pregnancy. Therefore, it is always advised to use some form of contraception. No, a woman cannot become pregnant if there is no vaginal penetration by the penis. A woman who has been having regular periods stops having them when she is pregnant. So, if a woman who has sex does not get her period on time, it might be a sign that she is pregnant. To be sure that she is pregnant, she needs to have a pregnancy test, as periods can also stop because of illness or tension. There were two signs of the stages of pregnancy: firstly, early signs of pregnancy were delayed menstrual periods (1-2 weeks beyond the expected date), nausea (vomiting sensation), tiredness, mood swings, pica (preference for pickles, sour food, earth, and pellets) and increased frequency in urination. Secondly, late signs of pregnancy were breasts becoming enlarged, nipples becoming darker, increased vaginal discharge, feeling the movement of a baby (usually starts around the 5th month) and enlarged abdomen. Laboratory tests can detect the pregnancy early and can confirm it 1. Urine pregnancy test (upt) 2. Ultrasound (usg) confirmatory test detection of hcg in maternal serum or urine can be done as early as 8-11 days of conception.",

          "context": "Risk factors for hiv behaviours and conditions that put individuals at greater risk of contracting hiv include: 1. Having unprotected anal or vaginal sex; 2. Multiple sexual partners or sex with sex workers; 3. Sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting; 4. Receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, tissue transplantation, medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; and 5. Experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers. The symptoms of hiv vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with hiv tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. The symptoms may be: 1. Fever for more than 3 weeks, 2. Cough or diarrhoea lasting more than 3 weeks which if dont get treated with routine a treatment 3. Weightless despite a good diet 4. Extreme weakness 5. Small multiples swellings in the neck, armpits, or groyne 6. Reddish rash on skin or white patches on mouth. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections, and cancers such as lymphomas and kaposi's sarcoma. Hiv can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected individuals, such as blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. Individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contacts such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food, or water. 5 the major routes of hiv transmission are: 1. Unprotected sexual intercourse with an hiv infected person; 2. Getting transfusion of hiv infected blood; 3. Contaminated syringes and needles; 4. Piercing of ears, nose or tattooing with contaminated instruments; 5. May spread from hiv positive mother to her baby. Hiv doesnt spread via the following modes or methods: 1. Dont spread by hugging; 2. Dont spread by shaking hands; 3. Dont spread by kissing on the cheek or forehead; 4. Dont spread by coughing or sneezing; 5. Dont spread by insect bites or mosquitoes; 6. Dont spread by sharing a towel, mobile, transport vehicle, toilets, or swimming pool; 7. Dont spread by sharing food or crockery. The concentration of hiv virus in saliva, tears, urine, and sweat is very low. Therefore, kissing on the cheek, forehead, or hand wont spread hiv. If a person is having an open-mouth kiss and has an oral ulcer or bleeding gums, then there are certain chances of hiv transmission. Some potential sources of hiv transmission are sharing razors, blades, and toothbrushes. Prevention of hiv: 1. Correct and consistent use of male condoms during vaginal or anal penetration can protect against the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including hiv; 2. A mutually faithful sexual relationship with only one partner; 3. Never reuse any needles or syringes. 4. Be careful with any transfusions, piercings, or cuts. Evidence shows that male condoms have an 85% or greater protective effect against hiv and other sexually transmitted infections (stis).",

          "context": "Waiting for the correct age and time for sex make sense due to three reasons: 1. Sex can lead to pregnancy. So, ask these questions before any sexual act: are you ready to be pregnant or become a teenage parent? It's a huge responsibility. Are you able to provide food, clothing, and a safe home for your baby? 2. Sex has health risks. A lot of infections can be spread during sex. Sexually transmitted infections include chlamydia, gonorrhoea, hepatitis b, herpes, hiv (the virus that causes aids), human papillomavirus (hpv), or syphilis. 3. Sex can lead to emotional pain and distractions. You may feel sad or angry if you let someone pressure you into having sex when you're not ready. You may also feel sad or angry if you choose to have sex, but your partner leaves you. Your partner may even tell other people that you had sex with him or her. Remember \"better be safe than sorry\". Pre-marital sex refers to sex before marriage. Socially, it may be considered wrong, depending on the culture and the individuals beliefs. A virgin is anyone (male or female) who has not had intercourse. It is not wrong to be a virgin. Being a virgin is totally normal, as a person is free to decide about his life and body. Most people wait for the right person and the right time to start their sexual lives. Choosing the right person and time is always a crucial part of making the right decision in life. Early exposure to sex may sometimes lead to mental and physical trauma and complications. Usually, people dont have a good experience with first-time sex, as they are inexperienced, shy, uncomfortable, and lacking knowledge. Being comfortable with the partner and environment can lead to good sex. Sex with a stranger or under the pressure or influence may be traumatic. Most of the time, people arent aware of how to provide or receive a sexual stimulation for sexual satisfaction. Not for all women feel that sex is painful the first time they have it. There may be some reasons for feeling pain. Here are some: 1. Mostly, it could be due to the rupture of the hymen, which may cause minute bleeding (mildly painful). Remember, most of the time, hymen may not be present or dont bleed. The presence of hymen is not a sign of virginity. At the second or subsequent time of sexual intercourse, it may bleed or cause pain. 2. Most females may not know how to relax their vaginal and pelvic muscles. 3. Due to anxiety and fear of penetration 4. Due to vaginismus or pain disorder. 5. The vagina may not be fully lubricated. A kiss is an expression of love, warmth, and affection towards loved ones. A kiss is a quick touching of lips to anothers body part, like on the cheek, lips, forehead, hands, etc. Depending on the location of the kiss, different connotations are implied.",

          "context": "Sexually transmitted infections (stis or stds) are infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Some stis may also be spread by skin-to-skin sexual contact or through non-sexual means, such as from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth. There are more than 30 known bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause stis. Eight of these pathogens are linked to the greatest incidence of sexually transmitted disease. Of these, four are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The other four are incurable viral infections: hepatitis b, herpes simplex virus (hsv), hiv and human papillomavirus (hpv). There are eight common infections. Out of which 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. However, the other 4 are viral infections and are incurable: hepatitis b, herpes simplex virus (hsv), human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), and human papillomavirus (hpv). Safe and highly effective vaccines are available for 2 stis: hepatitis b and hpv. Hpv causes cervical cancer in females and penile cancer in males. Symptoms may vary according to gender, severity, and type of stds: std in males: pus/discharge from the penis ulcer, the penis or scrotum pain or burning sensation on urination and swollen or painful testis. Std in females: pus/white, smelly discharge from the vagina, itching or ulcers around the vagina and pain or burning sensation on urination. Any person who indulges in sexual activity is at risk. One person can get multiple stds at the same time. People at higher risk are 1. Who has multiple sexual partners 2. Who has sex with commercial sex workers (prostitutes or sex workers) 3. Homosexual males (as anal sex has a higher risk of hiv transmission compared to vaginal sex). 4. Those who dont follow safe sex practises. The only guaranteed way to avoid or prevent stds is to abstain from sexual activity. The other ways are as follows: (i) avoid sex with unknown partners or multiple partners. (ii) always use condoms during coitus. (iii) in case of doubt, go to a qualified doctor for early detection and treatment (iv) get vaccinated against hepatitis b and hpv. The human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is a virus that targets the immune system and weakens the bodys defence systems against infections and some types of cancer. The most advanced stage of hiv infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), which can take from 2 to 15 years to develop, depending on the individual. Aids is defined by the development of certain cancers, infections, or other severe clinical manifestations. There is currently no cure or vaccine for hiv or aids. However, effective antiretroviral (arv) drugs can control the virus and help prevent transmission so that people with hiv, and those at substantial risk, can enjoy healthy, long, and productive lives.",

It lacks an emotional connection between two people. Most of the things are fake in it, as its all about acting fake and making money. 6. It hampers the concentration skill and with the thought process. Here are the possible side-effects of porn addiction - it kills the real love and romance - it creates a false expectation about sex, which can hamper the marriage /romantic relationship - it can mess up with your thought process, - hampers concentration leading to poor academic performance - it causes social isolation and loneliness - it can result in high-risk behaviour (more partners, paid sex, etc).

Take a break from the internet, mobile and laptop. 3. Use mobile applications or software to block the pornographic content in mobile and laptop. Restrict access to it. 4. Discuss it with your friends or can even take a medical consultation 5. Religious or spiritual involvement can significantly help 6. Consider masturbation without the use of pornography. 7. Avoid staying alone, spend most of the time with family and friends. 8. Engage in some activities like singing, dancing, painting, or writing. 9. Think of pornography addiction just like any other kind of addiction (i. E. , alcohol, drugs, food). Strategies to manage other addictive behaviours can be applied to pornography too.",

          "context": "There are lots of techniques to deal with peer pressure. 1. First, one must know what is good and bad for him; if he is unaware, he must talk to his parents or a responsible adult about it. 2. You must understand that peer-pressure is a long term or lifelong thing. You must take a stand, deal with it, and speak about it. Be assertive by speaking out when someone is being bullied or pressured into making a sexual decision that they dont want to make. 3. Be smart and patient, never act in the heat of the moment. Plan for it and try to find ways to deal with it in a subtle and smart way. 4. The best is to discuss with the people you trust, like your parents, teachers, or any responsible adults. They may be able to give you better ways or tricks to get away with it. The process of making decisions about sexual behaviour includes consideration of all positive and negative potential consequences. Decisions about sexual behaviour can affect peoples health, future, and life plans. There are factors that can make it difficult to make rational decisions about sexual behaviour like the range of emotions, alcohol and drugs, poverty, gender inequality, and violence. Decision-making is a skill that can be learned and practiced. Things a parent or guardian should do to have a good understanding of their child's sexual and reproductive health: 1. Never deny or ignore the questions of kids; always answer them with truth and logic. Kids are smart and intelligent. Dont underestimate them. 2. Never lie to a kid, as it leads to a loss of trust and faith. 3. Get their trust. So, in case of trouble or problems, they should come first to you with ease. 4. Never simply say dont do it\" or that is bad. Instead, always explain the real scientific reason for not doing so. 5. Always be careful with the words you use in front of kids. They listen, observe, and remember everything. They may learn bad things or bad words from you. 6. Never cross dress them when they are young. Example: never dress a boy as a girl, this may later impact him psychologically. 7. Never undress them in front of outsiders or unknown people. Give them full privacy and respect. 8. Teach them about good and bad touches. 9. Never force a kid if he/she is uncomfortable in hugging, kissing, or sitting in the lap of someone.",

Physical health risks associated with unsafe abortion include incomplete abortion (failure to remove or expel all pregnancy tissue from the uterus), haemorrhage (heavy bleeding), infection, uterine perforation (caused when the uterus is pierced by a sharp object), and damage to the genital tract. All types of elective abortions are illegal in malaysia except for certain exceptions. As a result, illegal and unsafe abortions are prevalent in malaysia, including self-induced abortions. Infertility is a condition in which a married couple is unable to conceive a baby through unprotected vaginal sex for one year. In an infertile couple, it is recommended that first the husband undergo the tests (investigations), as investigations for men (like semen analysis and scrotal ultrasounds) are cheaper and less invasive than investigations for females. Infertility has multiple causes, out of which 40% are due to male factors and 40% are due to female factors and 15-20% are due to unknown causes. Lifestyle changes that may boost fertility: 1. Quit smoking 2. Reduce alcohol consumption 3. Maintain a healthy weight according to your height 4. Dont consume drugs 5. Have a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables 6. Caffeine has a negative impact on womans fertility, so reduce its amount 7. Avoid exposure to overheat and radiation 8. Do a regular physical activity 9. Try to avoid stress and learn to manage it. Contraception is the intentional prevention of pregnancy by artificial or natural means. Contraception allows people to attain their desired number of children and to determine the spacing of pregnancies by delaying or preventing childbearing. Numerous contraceptive options are designated by duration and context of use (long-acting, permanent, short-term, emergency) and by method of operation (hormonal, nonhormonal, barrier, fertility awareness-based). Who and other international organisations recommend waiting 2 to 3 years between two pregnancies to reduce the deaths of babies and to benefit the mothers health. Research shows that a spacing of 3 to 5 years is more advantageous. Some adolescents may choose not to be sexually active, and some may choose to be sexually active. Here are the problems with adolescent pregnancy:1) pregnancy at an early age can result in complications (like eclampsia, puerperal endometritis and systemic infections, low birth weight, preterm delivery), which can also cause the death of the mother or child or both. 2) unsafe abortions among young girls can cause complications and death. 3) unmarried pregnant adolescents may face stigma, rejection or violence by partners, parents, and peers 4) research shows, girls who become pregnant before the age of 18 are more likely to experience violence within a marriage or partnership 5) adolescent pregnancy may also jeopardise girls future education and employment opportunities.",

Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practises, roles, and relationships.

It is influenced by biological factors (genes, hormones) only. Sexuality (gender): it is a central aspect of being human throughout life and encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, and reproduction. It can be other than male and female also. It can be influenced by the interaction of biological and external factors (psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, legal, historical, religious, and spiritual factors). Sexuality (gender identity) is persons internal, deeply felt sense of being male, female, other, or in between. Everyone has a gender identity. Sexual orientation: it refers to whether a person is sexually attracted (aroused) to a person of the same sex or different sex or gender. One does not have to be sexually active to have a sexual orientation. It also refers as established sexual preference. Sexual behaviour: it is the is the way humans experience and express their sexuality. It also refers as sexual action. Sexual orientation develops as you grow and experience new things.

Key danger signs during labour and childbirth: 1. Severe vaginal bleeding, 2. Prolonged labour, 3. Convulsions, 4. Retained placenta. Key danger signs during post-partum period: 1. Severe vaginal bleeding, 2. Foul smelling vaginal discharge, 3. High fever. Key danger signs in the newborn: 1. Convulsions /spasms/ rigidity, 2. Difficult/ fast breathing, 3. Very small baby, 4. Lethargy / unconsciousness. Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that can affect women after childbirth. Mothers with postpartum depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that may make it difficult for them to complete daily care activities for themselves or for others. Postpartum depression does not have a single cause but is likely results from a combination of physical and emotional factors. Only a health care provider can diagnose a woman with postpartum depression, as symptoms of this condition are broad and may vary between women. The condition, which occurs in nearly 15 percent of births, may begin shortly before or any time after childbirth, but commonly begins between a week and a month after delivery. Because of the severity of the symptoms, postpartum depression usually requires treatment, but it can be treated with counselling and medications. Please don't hesitate to consult with the doctor. The \"baby blues\" is a term used to describe the feelings of worry, unhappiness, and fatigue that many women experience after having a baby. Babies require a lot of care, so its normal for mothers to be worried about, or tired of providing that care. Baby blues, which affects up to 80% of mothers, includes feelings that are somewhat mild, last a week or two, and go away on their own. Abortion is generally illegal in malaysia, except in specific circumstances. The relevant law governing abortion in malaysia is the penal code, under sections 312 to 316. According to these sections, abortion is a criminal offence unless it is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman or if it is performed with the intention of preserving the woman's physical or mental health. In cases where an abortion is deemed necessary, it must be performed by a registered medical practitioner in a government-approved facility. Even in these circumstances, the law imposes certain restrictions and conditions, and it is subject to interpretation by the medical profession and the courts. Abortion is the medical termination of pregnancy (mtp) before 20 weeks of gestation. The four common indications for abortion (mtp) are: 1) therapeutic (for cure). 2) eugenic (child with defects). 3) failure of contraception. 4) danger to mother health. Under the section 312 of the penal code states that a termination of pregnancy is permitted in circumstances where there is a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or a threat of injury to her physical or mental health.",

          "context": "Homosexual (homo): people who have sexual or romantic feelings for people of the same sex. Example: men are attracted to men, and women are attracted to women. Sometimes people use the term gay for homosexual. Heterosexual (straight): people who have sexual or romantic feelings for people of the opposite gender. Example: men are attracted to women, and women are attracted to men. Just because a boy has some feminine qualities, or a girl acts a little \"male\" does not mean that he or she is homosexual. Gender reassignment is a process (surgery) in which some people go through to change their bodies in line with their gender identity. Hypersexual disorder refers to exhibiting unusual or excessive concern with or indulgence in sexual activity. It is called satyriasis among males and nymphomania in females. Asexuality is usually defined as having no sexual attraction to a partner of either sex. It is mostly self-identified based on a lack of sexual attraction or lack of sexual behaviour. Sometimes it may overlap with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (hsdd), which is defined as persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. Asexuality and hsdd are one of the grey areas, that is difficult to define. Cyberbullying involves posting or sending electronic messages (sometimes anonymously), including text, pictures, or videos, aimed at harassing, threatening, or spreading rumours and sexual remarks about another person via a variety of digital platforms such as online social networks, chat rooms, blogs, instant messaging, and text messaging. Cyberbullying has increased with the increased use of social media sites, the internet, e-mail, and mobile devices. Unlike more traditional bullying, cyberbullying can be more anonymous and occur nearly constantly. A person can be cyberbullied day or night, such as when they are checking their e-mail, using facebook or another social network site, or even when they are using a mobile phone. Cyber-victimisation has been associated with depression, anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, and behavioural problems. Technology gives youth new chances to be stalked by a current or former dating partner. Cyberstalking includes: 1. Unwanted, frightening, or offensive emails, text messages, or instant messages (ims) 2. Harassment or threats on social media 3. Tracking computer and internet use 4. Using technology such as gps to track a person. Remember: online predators can reach farther than you think. Signs that a child is a victim of cyber-bullying: 1) drastic change in their use of devices (sudden increase or decrease) 2) begins to avoid several social situations 3) displays extreme sadness, loss of interest, and isolation of people and activities. 4) they start to become secretive by hiding their screens when others are nearby. 5) sudden shut down of social media accounts or the creation of new ones.",

Negotiate with teenagers, especially when establishing limits, and explain your reasoning. 4. Practise consistency when enforcing rules. 5. Encourage a young persons self-expression. 6. Take the teens point of view into account when reasoning with him or her. Dealing with powerful media images of youth: 1. Explain that media images do not reflect the average person here is wide diversity in physical appearance and rate of development. 2. Point out how body sizes, shapes, and faces are altered in magazines and photographs using software programmes like photoshop. Waists and thighs are whittled, cheekbones sharpened, and lips plumped for women. Muscles are pumped up and defined, and complexions were smoothed for men. 3. Encourage critical thinking about the media and the nature of our consumers culture. Now is the perfect time to help teens develop their critical thinking skills help them question what is \"normal. \" 4. Turn to resources that reflect the realistic, diverse appearances of actual people. 5. Encourage activities that focus on attributes other than physical appearances, such as academics, sports, music, the arts, writing, or crafts. 6. Reinforce these messages regularly. Teaching decision-making strategies to children is crucial since adolescents need opportunities to practise and discuss realistic decision-making. Here are some ways adults can facilitate the process: 1. Get youth actively practising decision making through role-playing and group problem-solving exercises. 2. Look at how you make decisions and then lead by example. 3. Demonstrate to teens how to choose between competing pressures and demands. 4. Many adolescents live in the now. Show them the benefits of future thinking by anticipating difficult situations and planning how to handle them in advance. 5. Encourage adolescents to spend time with friends who share their values.

Never put up your personal details on the internet or social media like your full name, address, cell phone number, specific places they hang out, and financial information, ethnic background, school, or anything else that would help someone will locate you. 2. In cyberspace, theres no such thing as an \"erase\" buttonmessages, photos, rants, and musings can and do hang around forever. Information that may seem harmless now, but it can be used against you at any timeperhaps in the future when you are applying to college or looking for a job. Photos posted on the sites should not reveal too much personal information. 3. Shut down a personal website or blog if there is even a small threat of bullying or flaming. If necessary, get a new email address and instant messaging (im) identity. A sexual assault is any sexual act that a person did not consent to or was forced into against their will. It is a form of sexual violence and includes rape, or other sexual offences such as groping, forced kissing, child sexual abuse, or the torture of a person in a sexual manner. Sexual violence or assault can happen to anyone of any age: men, women, and children. Most young people who have been abused have been abused by someone they know e. G. , a neighbour, a driver, a relative, a family member, or a domestic helper. Your body is your own. It is your 'private property'. If someone touches you or clicks picture or records video in a way that you do not want or do not like, it is wrong. You must report this to your parents or responsible adults. Clicks picture or records video in a way that you do not want or do not like, it is wrong. You must report this to your parents or responsible adults. If sexual assault has happened to you, remember that it is not your fault; it is the abuser who did wrong, not you; it does not have to spoil your life. Look for help if you are feeling confused or bad. If you are in a situation that you feel might be abused, speak to someone you trust; try getting out of the situation if you can; try not to be alone with the abuser, and seek help soon. Abuse involves trust being broken and can make a person feel horrible or angry or scared or all these feelings and more. Adults may sexually molest young children as they may think: 1. It is easier to approach 2. Rejection is less damaging. 3. A sexual encounter is less threatening. 4. Wrong beliefs; remember: when you are young, no matter how much or how little you know about sex, it is not right for an adult to be sexual with you because it is called sexual abuse. It must be reported to parents or the police.",

          "context": "Depression is due to multiple factors resulting from complex mechanisms; there can be no single identifiable cause.

Following are the signs and symptoms of depression: 1. Frequent sadness, tearfulness, and crying 2. Decreased interest in activities or inability to enjoy formerly favourite activities 3. Hopelessness 4. Persistent boredom, low energy 5. Social isolation, poor communication 6. Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure 7. Increased irritability, anger, or hostility 8. Difficulty with relationships 9. Frequent complaints of physical illness, such as headaches or stomach-aches 10. Frequent absences from school or poor performance in school 11. Poor concentration 12. Feeling overwhelmed easily or often. 13. A major change in eating and/or sleeping patterns 14. Talk of or efforts to run away from home 15. Thoughts or expressions of suicide or self-destructive behaviour. Treatment of depression: there are various forms of treatment available, from counselling to medications.

You can count from 10 to 1 (reverse counting). 4. Set small goals and break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. 5. Exercise and eat regular meals. Involve in outdoor sports and be physically active. 6. Get proper sleep, at least 6-7 hours per day. 7. Break the habit of relying on caffeine or energy drinks to get through the day. 8. Focus on what you can control (your reactions, your actions) and let go of what you cannot (other peoples opinions and expectations). 9. Work through worst-case scenarios until they seem amusing or absurd 10. Lower unrealistic expectations. 11. Schedule breaks and enjoyable activities. 12. Accept yourself as you are; identify your unique strengths and build on them. 13. Give up on the idea of perfection, both in yourself and in others.",

          "context": "It is normal for young people to feel self-conscious and fret about their appearance. Occasionally, more serious difficulties arise as teens deal with physical changes. Potential unhealthy responses to physical changes include: 1. Fear, confusion, or withdrawal, especially during early adolescence (ages 10 -14years) 2. Obsessive concern about appearance 3. Excessive dieting or exercise 4. Early-maturing teens are exposed to social situations for which they may not be ready to handle (e. G. , being invited to parties with older teens) 5. Experiencing depression and eating disorders 6. Being bullied, teased, or excluded. The normal vaginal ph is 3.8 to 4.5 (acidic), it is due to the presence of lactobacillus bacteria (produces lactic acid). The acidic medium of vagina kills sperms and microbes (protects against infections). The optimum ph of sperm viability is 7 to 8.5. During the sexual intercourse, vagina ph is neutralised by the secretions of cervical mucus and seminal fluid for the passage of sperms into uterus without any damage. In most of the men, the right testicle is a little bigger than the left. The left testicle hangs lower compared to the right. These could be subjective finding or may be vice versa is some people, which may be normal. Physiological changes that cause morning erections due to nervous system changes that occur during sleep are1. Overcome the parasympathetic system in rem sleep over the sympathetic one. Stimulation of the parasympathetic system can cause a penile erection. 2. A full bladder can also stimulate the sacral nerve (parasympathetic system).",

          "context": "Signs of child abuse depend on the type of abuse, like physical abuse and sexual abuse: (1) signs of physical abuse (body): bruises, welts, burns, fractures, lacerations/cuts; (behaviour/s): extremes in moods, overly happy or sad, frightened of you, or other family or friends, doesnt want to be touched, gets upset when another child, cries, and tells you someone hit him/her. (2) sexual abuse signs (physically): torn, stained, bloody undergarments, pain or genital itching, bruises, bleeding or swelling of the genitals, has acquired a sexually transmitted disease, has seen on the mouth or genitals, pregnant. (behaviour/s): withdraws or engages in infantile behaviour poor peer relationships, does not want to do any physical activity, hides in his/her room, or does not want to go to, trying to tell you something but does not. Here are a few tips if a child uses bad or abusive words in his language: 1. Be careful about the language you use in front of your child. 2. Be firm and tell him that such language is not acceptable. 3. Most of the time, kids overhear someone using bad words and start using them without knowing the meaning. So first, find out what words he uses and ask him their meaning. If he doesnt know the meaning but can understand some, then explain it to him the meaning. He starts thinking twice before using such words. 4. Find out his source of learning and cut that source out. 5. Don't laugh and discourage your friends and family from laughing when he says a bad word. He will interpret laughter as encouragement. Try not to react at all. Maintain a poker face. If he can't get a rise out of you, he will soon tyre of these antics. 6. Use the reward and punishment method 7. You can provide them with different words for replacements.

          "context": "Infatuation refers to an intense and often short-lived emotional or romantic attraction towards someone. It is characterized by an intense passion, obsession, and idealization of the person, often accompanied by a heightened sense of excitement and euphoria. Infatuation is typically based on superficial qualities or idealized perceptions of the individual, and it often lacks a deep understanding of their true character or compatibility. Infatuation is primarily driven by intense emotions and physical attraction, and it may fade over time or evolve into a more mature and lasting form of love, or it may dissipate without developing into a long-term relationship. Lust refers to a strong and often overwhelming desire for sexual gratification or physical pleasure. It is primarily driven by intense sexual attraction or arousal, and it tends to be focused on the physical aspects of a person rather than their emotional or intellectual qualities. Lust is characterized by a strong and immediate sexual appetite, often detached from emotional connection or long-term commitment. It is a powerful and instinctual force, but it is transient and may fade once the sexual desire is fulfilled or if other aspects of a deeper connection are absent. Lust alone does not encompass the emotional intimacy and deeper emotional connection found in genuine love or healthy relationships. The differences between infatuation and love are infatuation is short-lived and based on superficial qualities, while love endures and encompasses deeper emotional connection. Infatuation is focused on physical attraction, while love includes care, compassion, and selflessness. Infatuation fluctuates in emotions, while love provides stability and understanding. Infatuation is self-centred, while love prioritizes the well-being of the other person. Infatuation is more present-focused, while love involves a long-term perspective. Infatuation lacks depth of connection, while love involves deep emotional and intellectual understanding. Infatuation may struggle with acceptance, while love allows for growth and acceptance of the other person. Infatuation and lust share some similarities, but they are not the same. While both involve intense feelings and desires, there are key differences between them which were infatuation involves intense emotional attraction, while lust is primarily driven by intense sexual desire. Infatuation can include emotional connection, while lust is focused on physical attraction. Infatuation may fade over time, while lust can be transient. Infatuation has the potential to evolve into deeper love, while lust may not lead to a long-term relationship. Infatuation is based on idealized perceptions, while lust is driven by immediate sexual gratification.",

          "context": "Friendships are built on trust, sharing, respect, empathy and solidarity. Friends can influence one another positively and negatively. Good friends will always care for you and may show you the correct path in life. They may be those who will become friends with you for their personal needs or with some different intentions. So, you have to be careful while selecting your friends. Girls and boys can be excellent friends with each other as long as they respect each other and maintain privacy. It's also good to have a friend of the opposite gender which provides with you a different perspective in life. Some friends are good for having a laugh with or sharing your favourite hobbies. And other friends can be there when you want to pour your heart out. The number of friends you have is not important. What matters is having friends that you are close to who can support you and wont try to hurt you or bully you. Be careful when choosing your friends, because a good friend will always care for you. A good friend will help you succeed and steer you in the correct direction. While a lousy friend may cause trouble for you. Tips to make friends: 1. Look out for people who have similar interests and hobbies. Most friendships start because people have things in common. 2. Go out and meet them. Sometimes we get so busy with our schedules that we don't get time to meet and talk with people. So you can meet people at some groups get-together party, etc. 3. You can always start a conversation with an introduction, greetings, or by asking, \"how are you? \" never be shy about talking; be confident and have a smiling face. 4. It is also imperative to be a good listener. 5. Compliment them. Don't be a miser about it. You can always compliment your friend about his or her looks, style, intelligence, clothes, skills, humour, etc. 6. Not everyone can be the same as you. Everyone is different, so accept others as they are. Dont try to change them. 7. Always share your food, meals, or belongings with your friends. Sharing is caring. 8. A person who helps others has a lot of friends who help him back later. 9. Be a loyal and trustworthy person.",

          "context": "Everyone has the right to decide who can touch their body, where and in what way. During puberty, private space becomes more important for both boys and girls, particularly while accessing to toilets for girls. Unwanted sexual attention towards both boys and girls is a violation of privacy and the right to decide about ones own body. Here are the differences between a good and bad touch, which should be taught to every toddler to protect them from any form of assault. Good touch: this touch doesnt scare you or doesnt make you uncomfortable, its not there on the private parts, it is mostly on hand or shoulder, it is never told to keep it as a secret, it is never forceful or hurting, it is never forceful or hurting. The example of good touch is parents hug, grandparents love, family hug, handshake and high five. Bad touch: the touch can make you feel scared or uncomfortable, it can be there on your private parts (genitals, hips, lips, chest), it may be told to keep it as a secret, it may be forceful or hurting. The example of bad touch is touching or patting on lips, chest, groin, and mouth. If someone doing the bad touch to you need to say no to it and report this immediately to the concerned authority or parents or a trustworthy adult. Generally, touching of private parts should only be done by oneself for personal hygiene purposes, or by trusted medical professionals during appropriate examinations or treatments. Consent and appropriate boundaries are crucial when it comes to touching private parts. It is important to teach children that their private parts are their own and that no one should touch them without their consent, except in situations where trusted adults, such as parents or caregivers, may need to provide necessary care or assistance. If someone other than a trusted person is attempting to touch or engage in any inappropriate behaviour involving private parts, it is important to report it to a trusted adult or authority figure immediately. Remember to never agree to keep a touch as a secret. Tell someone you trust. Whoever gives you a bad touch is the one who is bad, not you. Your body belongs to you. Consent is a permission or agreement for something to happen. It is always required before any physical touch or invading into someones privacy. A person has full power to refuse for any touch. It can be in written form (better) or in verbal form. 3 essentials things to teach a kid about good touch vs bad touch: 1. No one should touch your private parts. 2. No one should make you touch their private parts. 3. If someone asks you to do either of these things, it is never a secret that you have to keep. Tell this to mommy or daddy immediately, even if you have promised to keep it a secret, because this is a bad (evil) secret.",

          "context": "Breast size can vary significantly among females. There is a wide range of breast sizes and shapes, influenced by factors such as genetics, hormones, body composition, and overall health. Here are some general descriptions of breast sizes: small breasts: small breasts are typically characterized by a petite size with minimal breast tissue. They may have a flatter appearance and less projection from the chest wall. Average or medium-sized breasts: this is a common breast size range that varies depending on individual proportions. Average-sized breasts have a moderate amount of breast tissue and may have a rounded shape with moderate projection. Large breasts: large breasts have a significant amount of breast tissue and may have a fuller, rounder appearance. They typically project further from the chest wall and may require additional support. It's important to note that breast size is not an indicator of femininity or beauty, and every person's breasts are unique. There is no \"standard\" or \"ideal\" breast size, as beauty and attractiveness come in diverse forms. It's essential to focus on overall health and well-being rather than solely on breast size. If you have concerns about your breast size or any other aspect of your breasts, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance and support. Women wear bras or brassieres to support their breasts. As a girls breasts grow, she may need to get a different sized bra every couple of years, till her breasts have stopped growing. There is nothing unusual about this. Everyone grows at a different pace. A female needs to wear a bra when her breasts have grown enough to jiggle or bounce when she runs. A female feels more comfortable wearing a bra especially if she goes for jogging or any sport. There are various styles and sizes of bra available. The right bra is one that supports the breasts like a second skin. A female should wear a bra that is neither too tight nor too loose and preferably a cotton one. A woman should take off the bra at night to allow for proper blood circulation and so that she can breathe comfortably while sleeping. To determine if the bra you are wearing is suitable: band: the band should fit snugly around your torso without digging in or riding up.

          "context": "Waxing is a technique of hair removal that involves applying hot wax to an area of skin that is covered with a cloth or strip (muslin). Then the cloth or strip is quickly removed, extracting the wax and the hair. It is relatively safe, but it can cause microtrauma to the skin and its underlying structures, with reported complications that include folliculitis, local spread of infection, burns, and syringoma development. We all have hairs in our bodies at various sites (some people can have them in their ears also), and they all have some role in the body. Hair growth near the peri-anal region is completely normal, as it usually occurs during puberty. Facial hair (beard) growth depends mostly on genes and other factors. Some people grow a moustache or beard a little late, it is completely normal. Facial hair, or a moustache, is not a sign of masculinity. Shaving does not cause hair to grow faster, darker, or coarser. There is no strong scientific evidence to support these claims. Shaving doesnt have any effect on hair growth, as it removes only the dead portion of the hair. Never use a hair removal cream on the face, as the skin is too soft for those chemicals. You can use shaving cream, a razor, or an electronic trimmer. Presence of some amount of facial hair (few and thin) in a female is a common thing. But the presence of course and dense facial hair in females may be due to some hormonal imbalance conditions like polycystic ovary disease (pcod), ovarian tumour, etc. You were advised to consult with the doctor for more information and a checkup. Body hair depends on genetics, environment, and other factors. So dont worry about it; it is completely normal.",

Check the expiry date of the condom, as an expired condom can break easily. Open the condom carefully, dont use your nails or sharp items which can damage it. Step2. Place the condom on the head of the erect and hard penis. If uncircumcised penis, pull back the foreskin first. Step 3. Pinch air out of the tip of the condom. If air is present then, there is a high chance of breakage. Step 4. Unroll condom all the way down the penis. After this, penis can be inserted into the vagina. Dont use any lubrication, as condoms are pre-lubricated and vaginal secretions also act as lubricants. Step 5. After sex before pulling out the penis, hold the condom at the base. Then pull out, while holding the condom in place. Withdrawal the penis, while the penis is still erect. Take off the condom without spilling semen on the vagina. Step 6. Carefully remove the condom, tie a knot at the open end of the condom, cover it in a wrapper or paper, and throw it in the trash. Never reuse them. They are sugar-coated (flavoured) condoms usually used for oral sex (where a penis is involved). They shouldnt be used for vaginal-penile sex, as sugar can lead to secondary infections in the vagina. Also, the vagina doesnt have any taste buds. Never use any plastic sheet or anything except condoms, as they may break or slip easily, causing pregnancy. Also, introducing any unsterile thing into the vagina can cause infections, and the irregular surfaces can cause trauma or injury. Condoms are easily available at most pharmacies and general shops. They are also freely distributed by the government through various modes.",

          "context": "Sexual abuse is a term used to describe any sexual activity that is unwanted or carried out without consent. It may include touching and non-touching activity. Touching activity includes kissing, hugging, fondling, oral sex, or penetration. Non-touching activity includes exposure to sexual acts or pornography. Child sexual abuse is any interaction between a child and an adult (or another child) in which the child is used for the sexual stimulation of the perpetrator or an observer. Sexual abuse can include both touching and non-touching behaviours. Non-touching behaviours can include voyeurism (trying to look at a childs naked body), exhibitionism, or exposing the child to pornography. Children of all ages, races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds may experience sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse can include both touching and non-touching behaviours. Touching activities include touching a childs genitalia (private parts) for sexual pleasure. Making a child touch someones genitals, play a sexual game, or have sex. Putting any object or any body part (finger, tongue, etc. ) inside the vagina or mouth, or anus for sexual pleasure. Non-touching activities include deliberately exposing an adults genitals to a child, inappropriately watching undress or while using the bathroom, showing pornography to a child, photographing a child in sexual poses, encouraging a child to watch sexual acts, and showing or flashing genitals to a child. Under malaysian law, rape is defined as sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or against her will. A man who commits rape shall be punished for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to whipping, if he has sexual intercourse with a woman under any of the following circumstances: (g) with or without her consent, when she is under 16 years of age. Sex with a girl below 16 years of age is statutory rape, regardless of whether she consents to it or not. 1. Rape: rape is defined under section 375 of the penal code. It refers to non-consensual sexual intercourse with a person without their consent. The offense is gender-neutral, meaning it can be committed against both men and women. 2. Sexual assault: while the term \"sexual assault\" is not specifically defined in the malaysian penal code, it generally refers to any non-consensual sexual act or contact that does not involve penetration. It can include various forms of unwanted sexual touching, groping, or other acts of a sexual nature without the individual's consent. 3. Unlawful sexual connection: under section 377b of the penal code, unlawful sexual connection refers to any act of penetration (including oral or anal penetration) without the consent of the person involved. This provision covers non-consensual sexual acts that fall short of the legal definition of rape. 4. Sexual abuse: sexual abuse encompasses a broad range of non-consensual sexual acts, including acts of indecent assault, molestation, or any other form of sexual misconduct. While the term \"sexual abuse\" may not be specifically defined in the penal code, it can encompass various forms of unwanted sexual contact or behaviour that violates a person's boundaries.",

          "context": "Healthy vaginal discharge is a normal and natural occurrence that helps keep the vagina clean and lubricated. It varies in consistency, colour, and odor throughout the menstrual cycle. Generally, healthy vaginal discharge can range from clear to white or slightly yellowish in colour. It is usually odourless or has a mild, musky scent. The consistency can be thin and watery or thicker and sticky, depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle. On the other hand, unhealthy vaginal discharge may indicate an underlying issue or infection. Signs of unhealthy discharge include unusual colour: discharge that is green, grey, or has a strong yellow hue may indicate an infection or other health concern. Unpleasant odour: foul-smelling discharge, especially if it is accompanied by itching, irritation, or discomfort, could be a sign of an infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or a sexually transmitted infection (sti). Abnormal consistency: if the discharge becomes clumpy, cottage cheese-like, frothy, or has an unusual texture, it could be a sign of a yeast infection or another type of infection. Itching, irritation, or burning: discharge accompanied by persistent itching, redness, or a burning sensation may indicate an infection or allergic reaction. If you notice any significant changes in your vaginal discharge that are accompanied by other symptoms or concerns, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider. They can evaluate your symptoms, perform necessary tests, and provide appropriate treatment if needed. The colour of menstrual blood can vary from person to person and can change throughout the duration of the menstrual cycle. Typically, menstrual blood is shades of red, ranging from bright red to dark red. However, it is common for the colour to be slightly different at the beginning and end of the period. At the start of the menstrual cycle, the bleeding may be brighter red and slightly heavier. As the period progresses, the blood may become darker and may have a brownish or even blackish tinge. This is because the blood may take some time to exit the body and may be exposed to oxygen, which can cause it to change in colour. The colour of menstrual blood can also be influenced by factors such as the flow rate, hormonal changes, and the presence of blood clots. If you notice any significant changes in the colour of your menstrual blood or have concerns about your menstrual health, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance. A normal period typically lasts between three to seven days. However, it's important to note that menstrual cycles can vary from person to person, and what is considered \"normal\" can differ for everyone. Some people may have shorter or longer periods, ranging from two to eight days. It's also common for the length and characteristics of periods to change over time due to factors such as age, hormonal changes, stress, and underlying health conditions. If you have concerns about the duration or pattern of your menstrual period, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare provider.",

          "context": "The breasts are the mammary glands located on the chest of females and, to a lesser extent, males. They are a prominent part of the female reproductive system and play a role in milk production for breastfeeding. Breasts are composed of glandular tissue, fat, and connective tissue, and their size, shape, and appearance can vary from person to person. Breasts typically consist of a nipple, areola (the pigmented area surrounding the nipple), and breast tissue that extends outward from the chest wall. The breast tissue contains milk ducts and lobules, which produce and transport milk during lactation. Hormonal changes during puberty, menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can affect the size and sensitivity of breasts. Apart from their biological function, breasts can also have cultural, aesthetic, and emotional significance for individuals. Regular breast self-examination and routine breast health screenings are important for early detection of any abnormalities or changes in breast tissue. If you have concerns about your breast health, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider. Lactation is the natural process of producing and secreting milk from the breasts, primarily occurring in females after childbirth to nourish and provide essential nutrients to the newborn. Breasts start producing milk (called lactation) after the delivery of the baby. Newborn babies are fed exclusively only on breast milk for the first 6 months of life. Milk production is a highly coordinated system between the nervous system and endocrine system of the body. Amount of milk production also depends on the sucking of breast nipple the baby, nutritional status of the mother, physical activity, and healthy lifestyle. Normally breasts secrete from 450ml to 800ml of milk after pregnancy. If a woman who never got pregnant starts women start lactating, then she must consult a doctor for further evaluation of the cause. It is advised to avoid losing weight rapidly after pregnancy, as it can interfere with lactation. It is relatively common for some females to experience a delay or difficulty in milk production after giving birth, but it is not considered the norm. With proper support and breastfeeding techniques, milk production typically starts within a few days after childbirth. However, in rare cases, some females may have challenges in producing sufficient milk supply despite their efforts. Seeking guidance from healthcare professionals or lactation consultants is important in such situations. It's important to remember that there are alternative feeding options available to ensure the baby receives proper nutrition if breastfeeding is not possible.",

          "context": "When a boy is sexually excited, his penis becomes hard and stands up. This is known as an erection or a hard-on and occurs because of increased blood flow to the penis. This is a normal phenomenon. Erections sometimes occur on their own, without any sexual stimulus. During sleep, there is some change in the nervous system of the body, causing erection of the penis in the morning or in sleep. This is perfectly natural and normal. It does not mean that a man is over-sexed. Semen is a white, thick liquid containing sperms mixed with the secretions of the epididymis and prostate. It is made up of sperms, sugar, water, enzymes, and protein. The normal quantity of semen per ejaculation is 1.5 to 4 ml, containing about 20 to 80 million sperms/ml. Emission of the semen during masturbation or during erection is completely normal; there shouldnt be any guilt or bad feelings about it. The production of sperm is a continuous process that doesnt stop. Normal semen colour is white grey in colour. It can have a yellowish tinge sometimes when there is prolonged abstinence (from masturbation or sex), which is due to carotene pigment, and sperm oxidation causes odour. If a person ejaculates frequently (e. G. , too many times in a day), then the colour may be watery (mildly transparent), which is a temporary condition and normal. The colour of semen may change due to fresh blood (red), drugs (pyridium), jaundice (dark yellow), or contamination of semen with urine (e. G. , in bladder neck dysfunction). A person needs to consult a doctor if there is any abnormal semen colour (red, dark yellow, brown, green, etc). \"nocturnal emission or nightfall or wet dreams is the spontaneous ejaculation of semen during sleep. Many adolescents get scared when it occurs first. It is a normal physiological process. It occurs after reaching puberty. It doesnt lead to weakness or impotence. No, if a man never had nocturnal emission, it doesnt mean that he has any abnormality. Sometimes women may also get erotic dreams in sleep and some vaginal secretions may be released, which can be compared to a nocturnal emission. It can be seen in rare case of retrograde ejaculation (in which semen comes out with urine just after every orgasm). Research shows that normal people who are very much frightened about the semen loss may also report it, due to the anxiety/depression or sexual dysfunction (as they think semen as extremely precious body element). It is often even called as dhat syndrome. The management includes sex education for the misconception, counselling, relaxation therapy and some anti-anxiety medications (if needed).",

          "context": "Menstruation, commonly called periods occurs only in females. Its a regular shedding of the inner layer (endometrium layer) of the uterus. The menstrual cycle is regulated by hormones in the body. It is called a menstrual cycle because, after every 28 days, there is uterine bleeding that comes out through the vagina. The date of menstrual bleeding (bleeding through the vagina) is noted in the calendar as day 1 (first day of the cycle) and the bleed continues for 3-5 days. Then the release of the egg (ovum) from the ovary on the 14th day of the cycle and the next menstrual bleeding occurs after 2830 days. It is always good to keep a diary or note of the period dates, so a girl can be prepared. For her next period, and it is also helpful in making future plans. There are also lots of mobile applications or online websites to calculate or make notes of it. If the menstrual bleeding started on 10th january (day 1), then the ovulation date will be 28th january (14 days after) and the next menstrual bleed will occur around 7th february (28th day). It is the time period of the menstrual cycle during which, if unprotected sexual intercourse is done, there is a higher chance of fertilisation of the ovum with sperm leading to pregnancy. Ovulation occurs on the 14th day and lasts for 3 days. Sperm has a life span of 72 hours (3 days). So, the fertile period ranges from the 10th day until the 17th day of the menstrual cycle. A couple can use this knowledge to conceive a baby. Use of this knowledge for contraception is not advisable due to the higher failure rate. Menstruation usually starts by the age of 10 to 15 years (called menarche). If after 16 years also your menstruation doesnt start, then you need to consult a doctor. There may be underlying causes like an imperforate hymen, an absent or anomalous uterus, a hormonal disorder, etc. The menstrual cycle (periods) occurs due to hormonal changes. As soon as the bleeding from the uterus stops, the body starts preparing for pregnancy with the hope that in the next cycle, pregnancy will occur (by fertilisation with sperm) and the thickness of the inner layer of the uterus will increase. When the ovum doesnt meet sperm during the fertile period, the inner thickened lining (endometrium) of the uterus starts shedding and comes out in the form of blood through the vagina.",

          "context": "Dating refers to a social or romantic activity where two individuals, typically interested in each other, spend time together to get to know each other better. It is a process of exploring compatibility and establishing a potential romantic or sexual relationship. Dating can involve a range of activities, such as going out for meals, engaging in shared interests or hobbies, attending events together, or simply spending quality time getting to know each other. It can occur in various contexts, including casual dating, where individuals are exploring multiple connections, or in more exclusive relationships, where the focus is on building a deeper emotional connection and potential long-term commitment. The purpose of dating is to assess compatibility, develop intimacy, and determine if there is potential for a deeper and more committed partnership. Dating apps are online platforms or mobile applications that allow people to connect and interact with others who are interested in romantic or sexual relationships. Users create profiles, browse through potential matches, and communicate with others through messaging within the app. These apps provide a convenient and accessible way to meet new people and explore potential connections. However, it's important to prioritize personal safety and exercise caution when using dating apps as there are lots of strangers with fake profile. These people with wrong intentions use this platform (social media/dating platforms) for kidnapping, blackmailing, sexual assault, phishing, data theft, human trafficking, etc. Dating violence can be emotional, physical, or sexual. Dating violence also includes stalking. In any form of dating violence, a person should seek for help from parents/guardians, friends or authority. If needed, you can always take help of police and legal system. 1. Emotional violence is when one partner threatens the other or harms his or her sense of self-worth or self-esteem. Emotional violence includes things like calling names, behaving in a controlling or jealous way, monitoring the other person constantly, shaming, or bullying. Emotional violence also happens when someone keeps the other away from friends and family. 2. Physical violence is when someone pinches, hits, shoves, slaps, punches, or kicks their partner. 3. Sexual violence is when someone forces a partner to have sex or engage in sexual activities when he or she does not or cannot consent. Force can be physical or nonphysical. An example of nonphysical violence is when someone threatens to spread rumours if a partner refuses to have sex. 4. Stalking is any form of repeated and unwanted contact that makes a person feel unsafe.",

          "context": "Nothing much will happen to a male if they take an oral contraceptive pill or emergency pill, but it is advised not to do so. If the sexual intercourse was done in the last 72 hours, then a female can take an emergency contraceptive pill. A married woman can even choose intrauterine copper t (which is effective within 5 days of unprotected sex). If it is more than 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse, then you can wait for the girls next period (as every sexual intercourse may not lead to pregnancy). If her next period is missed, she may need to undergo a pregnancy test. Therefore, it is always advised to use protection. There is no data available for how long before an emergency pill can be taken. However, mostly, it can be taken just before the intercourse. The least effective are natural methods. Therefore, it is always advised to avoid using natural methods, as there is a high chance of failure. Condoms provide approximately 80% protection against sexually transmitted diseases (stds). Condoms have a high failure rate of 12%, but if they are used properly, the failure rate can be reduced to 3%. They can fail due to slippage, breakage, etc. Dont panic if a condom breaks or slips. You can use emergency contraception, or you can wait for the next menstrual cycle. If there is a delay in the menstrual cycle beyond 1 week, then contact a doctor for further evaluation and management. Dos for condom use: do use a condom every time you have sex. Do put on a condom before having sex. Do read the package and check the expiration date. Do make sure there are no tears or defects. Do store condoms in a cool, dry place. Do use latex or polyurethane condoms. Do use water-based or silicone-based lubricant to prevent breakage. Dont for condom use: dont store condoms in your wallet as heat and friction can damage them. Dont use nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide), as this can cause irritation. Dont use oil-based products like baby oil, lotion, petroleum jelly, or cooking oil because they will cause the condom to break. Dont use more than one condom at a time. It may cause friction and lead to the breakage of the condom dont reuse a condom. Dont wash a condom dont use latex condom if you are allergic to latex",

          "context": "The groin is the area of the body located between the abdomen and the thigh on either side of the pubic bone. It is also referred to as the inguinal region. The groin area is where the lower abdomen meets the upper inner thigh. It contains various structures, including muscles, lymph nodes, blood vessels, and the inguinal canal. The groin area is commonly associated with the hip joints and is susceptible to strains or injuries, particularly in physically active individuals. Itching in the groin area can be a common occurrence and may be caused by various factors. It can be considered normal if it is mild and temporary. However, persistent, or intense itching in the groin area may indicate an underlying issue that requires attention. Some possible causes of itching in the groin area include fungal infections: conditions such as jock itch (tinea cruris) caused by a fungal infection can lead to itching in the groin region. Contact dermatitis: exposure to irritants or allergens in soaps, detergents, fabrics, or personal care products can cause itching and skin irritation in the groin area. Moisture and friction: excessive moisture, sweat, and friction in the groin area, particularly in warm or humid environments, can lead to itching and skin irritation. Skin conditions: certain skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis can manifest with itching in the groin area. Hygiene practices: poor hygiene, infrequent bathing, or using harsh soaps can contribute to itching and discomfort in the groin region. If you are experiencing persistent or severe itching in the groin area, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider or dermatologist. They can assess your specific situation, provide an accurate diagnosis, and recommend appropriate treatment options to relieve the itching and address any underlying causes. Ways to deal with groyne fungal infection / itchy groyne: 1. Wear loose underwear, if needed then can avoid underwear for few days. 2. Keep the groyne dry after the bath; make sure to wear only dry underwear. 3. If needed, remove pubic hair so the medications can be applied easily, and the groyne remains dry for a longer duration. 4. Dont share a towel, undergarment, or soap. 5. Use anti-fungal creams like clotrimazole, etc. 6. Feel free to consult a doctor.",

          "context": "The normal adult penis size should be more than 3 cm in the flaccid state. While in an erect state, it can range from 3 to 6 inches. The erect penis should be long enough to reach the vagina for sexual intercourse. The size of the penis depends mainly on the race (genetics); it cant be changed. Men are generally obsessed with penis size. Research has shown that the size and width of the penis have nothing to do with sexual performance in males. Sexual performance depends on the mood, correct technique, and intimacy with the partner. Generally, for a woman, sexual intimacy (passion or love) and foreplay with the partner matter more than penetration. No, till now there is no adequate scientific data to prove any method or medication can increase the penis size. These methods may falsely claim to sell their products or technique. However, some surgeries are possible to increase the length or girth of the penis, but it can be dangerous, as they have certain complications. It is common/normal to have a slightly curved/tilted penis to right or left in an erect penis. But if it is significantly bent and causes pain or difficulty in sex/urination, then it could be peyronies disease. You may have to consult a doctor for further evaluation. Penis does not have a bone, it has only muscles (corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum covered by tunica albuginea). Sometimes penile fracture term can be used as in a hospital emergency as tear in the tunica albuginea of the penis often due to forceful manipulation, vigorous vaginal or anal intercourse or masturbation, gunshot wounds, or any other mechanical trauma that causes forcible bending of an erect penis. Less common causes include turning over in bed, a direct blow, forced bending, or hastily removing or applying clothe when the penis is erect. The most common mechanism of injury is during sexual intercourse when the penis slips out of the vagina and strikes against the symphysis pubis or perineum.",

          "context": "1. The prostate is a gland that makes fluid for semen. This gland also surrounds the urethra at the neck of the urinary bladder. It is a small gland found in males, located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It is part of the male reproductive system and plays a role in the production and secretion of seminal fluid, which helps nourish and transport sperm during ejaculation. The prostate gland is roughly the size and shape of a walnut. It surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body, and the urethra runs through the middle of the prostate. The prostate gland undergoes changes throughout a man's life, with the most significant growth occurring during puberty. Prostate problems in old age happen due to the increase in age as the size of the prostate increases due to hormones, genes, etc. It is called \"benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). Due to the growth of the prostate, it compresses the urethra (blocks it), which causing symptoms like 1. Increased urinary frequency (urination eight or more times a day); 2. Urinary urgency (the inability to delay urination) 3. Trouble starting a urine stream 4. A weak or interrupted urine stream 5. Dribbling at the end of urination 6. Nocturia (frequent urination during sleep) 7. Urinary retention 8. Urinary incontinence (the accidental loss of urine) 9. Pain after ejaculation or during urination 10. Urine that has an unusual colour or smell 11. A person needs medical help. It can be treated or controlled using medicines or surgery. The myths (misconception) about masculinity or manhood:1. Real men don't show emotions. Its healthy for all individuals to express and process their emotions. 2. Real men are always tough and aggressive. Strength can be shown through empathy, compassion, and emotional intelligence. 3. Real men don't seek help or show vulnerability. Seeking support is a sign of strength and prioritizing mental well-being. 4. Real men are successful and financially dominant. True masculinity is not solely based on external achievements but on qualities like integrity and personal growth. 5. Real men are always interested in sex and should be sexually dominant. Individual preferences and consent should guide sexual relationships. Challenging these myths fosters inclusivity and allows men to embrace their authentic selves.",

It is a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and sexual orientation. Sexual fantasies are usually associated with masturbation, but the two can occur independently. Sexual daydreams and fantasies are commonmost people have them, not just teenagers and not just boys. Fantasies often differ between males and females. Sexual aggression and dominance are recurring themes in young male fantasies and usually contain very specific and graphic sexual behaviours with little emotional involvement. For adolescent females, sexual fantasies often involve relating to others, and they are more likely to involve sexual activities with which the girl is already familiar. A teenage girls fantasies are also typically about someone they know (a boyfriend, tv or music stars, friends, or casual acquaintances). The important thing about sexual fantasies is that they are just thoughts. There is nothing to feel guilty or ashamed about. It doesnt reflect about you being sick, weird, or wrong. When you see something that is romantic, sexy, or exciting, it is natural to feel something happen in your body. Some people feel their heartbeat increasing or feel sweaty; their pulse might race; they feel a tingle in some part of the body, girls might feel slight wetness in the vagina and boys might have an erection accompanied by semen coming out. During the teen years, the body is just getting used to these new sensations, and sometimes you might find yourself reacting like this quite suddenly. With time, you will be more in control of these physical feelings. Whenever you have any doubt or concern about anything, you should seek guidance from a knowledgeable person like your parents, doctor, or teacher. Friends may not be a good source.",
