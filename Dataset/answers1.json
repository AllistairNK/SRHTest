Breast cancer can affect both women and men, although it is more common in women. The risk factors for breast cancer are positive family history (genetics), prolonged exposure to endogenous oestrogen (such as early menarche, late menopause, and late age at first childbirth), exogenous hormones, radiation, alcohol use, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity.",

Multiple sexual partners or sex with sex workers; 3. Sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting; 4. Receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, tissue transplantation, medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; and 5. Experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers.�The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. The symptoms may be: 1. fever for more than 3 weeks, 2. cough or diarrhoea lasting more than 3 weeks which if don�t get treated with routine a treatment 3. weightless despite a good diet 4. extreme weakness 5. small multiples swellings in the neck, armpits, or groyne 6. Reddish rash on skin or white patches on mouth. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma.�HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected individuals, such as blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. Individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contacts such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food, or water. 5 The major routes of HIV transmission are: 1. Unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV infected person; 2. Getting transfusion of HIV infected blood; 3. Contaminated syringes and needles; 4. Piercing of ears, nose or tattooing with contaminated instruments; 5. May spread from HIV positive mother to her baby.�HIV doesn�t spread via the following modes or methods: 1. Don�t spread by hugging; 2. Don�t spread by shaking hands; 3. Don�t spread by kissing on the cheek or forehead; 4. Don�t spread by coughing or sneezing; 5. Don�t spread by insect bites or mosquitoes; 6. Don�t spread by sharing a towel, mobile, transport vehicle, toilets, or swimming pool; 7. Don�t spread by sharing food or crockery. The concentration of HIV virus in saliva, tears, urine, and sweat is very low. Therefore, kissing on the cheek, forehead, or hand won�t spread HIV. If a person is having an open-mouth kiss and has an oral ulcer or bleeding gums, then there are certain chances of HIV transmission. Some potential sources of HIV transmission are sharing razors, blades, and toothbrushes. Prevention of HIV: 1. Correct and consistent use of male condoms during vaginal or anal penetration can protect against the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV; 2. a mutually faithful sexual relationship with only one partner; 3. Never reuse any needles or syringes. 4. Be careful with any transfusions, piercings, or cuts.

Therefore, it is advised not to douche. Menstruations usually stop by the age of 50 (called menopause). In some cases, they may stop quite early or late. The age of menopause may depend on genetics and lifestyle (smoking, obesity, physical activity, and diet).�\"Menopausal transition� or �perimenopause� is the time before the menopause (approx. 40 to 50 years of age). In this period, there are hormonal and emotional changes. These symptoms vary from person to person, from mild to severe. This period is characterised by 1. Menstrual irregularities (periods may come very close together, heavy bleeding, spotting, irregular periods, episodes of amenorrhea) 2. Vasomotor symptoms like 3. red blotches, hot flushes (sudden feeling of heat not only disturb women at work and interrupt daily activities, but they also disrupt sleep.) 4. Vaginal dryness, sexual dysfunction 5. Mood changes, some may have depression and irritation; however, these symptoms can be easily managed by counselling, mental preparation, avoiding coffee and some mild measures. If a woman feels problematic to handle, then please feel free to consult your doctor for medications.�",

Wash the genital area from outside with plain water (no soap) after each use of toilet or urination. 7. Keep the area between legs dry, otherwise chaffing or soaring may develop. 8. Eat a healthy diet, iron-rich diet like green leafy vegetables. 9. Always carry an extra sanitary napkin with you, whenever going out.  10. After using the sanitary napkin (pad), wrap it in paper and dispose of in a closed lid dustbin. Never dispose of the sanitary pad in an open place or in the toilet. 11. Exercise can help in relieving the symptoms like premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea and relieve bloating. Exercise also causes the release of serotonin, making one feel much happier. 12. If feeling tired then rest can be taken. Drink adequate water and be hydrated. 13. A heating pad or hot water fomentation can be applied over the abdomen (tummy) to relive the pain or cramps. For cramps and back pain, simple painkillers like paracetamol, mefenamic acid can also be taken. 14. Maintain a calendar/diary, so you are prepared for the next cycle.",

Contraception is the intentional prevention of pregnancy by artificial or natural means. Contraception allows people to attain their desired number of children and to determine the spacing of pregnancies by delaying or preventing childbearing. Numerous contraceptive options are designated by duration and context of use (long-acting, permanent, short-term, emergency) and by method of operation (hormonal, nonhormonal, barrier, fertility awareness-based). WHO and other international organisations recommend waiting 2 to 3 years between two pregnancies to reduce the deaths of babies and to benefit the mother�s health. Research shows that a spacing of 3 to 5 years is more advantageous. Some adolescents may choose not to be sexually active, and some may choose to be sexually active. Here are the problems with adolescent pregnancy:1) Pregnancy at an early age can result in complications (like eclampsia, puerperal endometritis and systemic infections, low birth weight, preterm delivery), which can also cause the death of the mother or child or both. 2) Unsafe abortions among young girls can cause complications and death. 3) Unmarried pregnant adolescents may face stigma, rejection or violence by partners, parents, and peers 4) Research shows, girls who become pregnant before the age of 18 are more likely to experience violence within a marriage or partnership 5) Adolescent pregnancy may also jeopardise girls� future education and employment opportunities.",

Sometimes people use the term �gay� for homosexual.�Heterosexual (straight): people who have sexual or romantic feelings for people of the opposite gender. Example: Men are attracted to women, and women are attracted to men. Just because a boy has some feminine qualities, or a girl acts a little \"Male\" does not mean that he or she is homosexual. Gender reassignment is a process (surgery) in which some people go through to change their bodies in line with their gender identity. Hypersexual disorder refers to exhibiting unusual or excessive concern with or indulgence in sexual activity. It is called �satyriasis� among males and �nymphomania� in females. Asexuality is usually defined as having no sexual attraction to a partner of either sex. It is mostly self-identified based on a lack of sexual attraction or lack of sexual behaviour. Sometimes it may overlap with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), which is defined as persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. Asexuality and HSDD are one of the grey areas, that is difficult to define. Cyberbullying involves posting or sending electronic messages (sometimes�anonymously), including text, pictures, or videos, aimed at harassing, threatening, or spreading rumours and sexual remarks about another person via a variety of digital platforms such as online social networks, chat rooms, blogs, instant messaging, and text messaging. Cyberbullying has increased with the increased use of social media sites, the Internet, e-mail, and mobile devices. Unlike more traditional bullying, cyberbullying can be more anonymous and occur nearly constantly. A person can be cyberbullied day or night, such as when they are checking their e-mail, using Facebook or another social network site, or even when they are using a mobile phone.�Cyber-victimisation has been associated with depression, anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, and behavioural problems.

However, Natural methods have higher chances of failure compared to the�temporary and permanent methods.�Vasectomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting or blocking the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethra. It is a form of permanent contraception for men, as it prevents sperm from reaching the semen ejaculated during sexual intercourse. After a vasectomy, men typically continue to produce sperm, but the sperm are absorbed by the body instead of being ejaculated. The testicles still produce hormones, including testosterone, so there is usually no change in sexual desire, performance, or the ability to achieve an erection. It's important to note that vasectomy is intended to be a permanent form of contraception, and while reversal procedures are available, they are not always successful. Therefore, it is recommended that men consider vasectomy as a permanent decision and carefully discuss the procedure with a healthcare professional to fully understand the implications and alternatives.",

The exact age at which breast development starts can vary among individuals, but it commonly begins between the ages of 8 and 13. Breast development usually progresses through several stages over a span of a few years. Initially, small breast buds form beneath the nipple area, and gradually the breasts continue to grow and take on a more rounded shape. The size and pace of breast development can differ among individuals. Breast growth generally continues until the late teenage years or early twenties, but it varies for each person. The rate of growth and the final size of the breasts are influenced by factors such as genetics, hormones, and overall health. It's important to note that breast size is highly individual and can differ significantly among individuals.",

Measure the bust: Keep the measuring tape around your back and bring it across the fullest part of your bust. Make sure the tape is not too tight or too loose and record the measurement. Calculate the difference: Subtract your under bust measurement from your bust measurement. The difference between the two measurements will determine your cup size.

          "context": "Breast development, also known as breast budding, typically begins during puberty, which is a period of physical and hormonal changes that occur in girls. The exact age at which breast development starts can vary among individuals, but it commonly begins between the ages of 8 and 13. Breast development usually progresses through several stages over a span of a few years. Initially, small breast buds form beneath the nipple area, and gradually the breasts continue to grow and take on a more rounded shape. The size and pace of breast development can differ among individuals. Breast growth generally continues until the late teenage years or early twenties, but it varies for each person. The rate of growth and the final size of the breasts are influenced by factors such as genetics, hormones, and overall health. It's important to note that breast size is highly individual and can differ significantly among individuals.

          "context": "Friendships are built on trust, sharing, respect, empathy and solidarity.� Friends can influence one another positively and negatively.� Good friends will always care for you and may show you the correct path in life. They may be those who will become friends with you for their personal needs or with some different intentions.� So, you have to be careful while selecting your friends. Girls and boys can be excellent friends with each other as long as they respect each other and maintain privacy. It's also good to have a friend of the opposite gender which provides with you a different perspective in life. Some friends are good for having a laugh with or sharing your favourite hobbies. And other friends can be there when you want to pour your heart out. The number of friends you have is not important. What matters is having friends that you are close to who can support you and won�t try to hurt you or bully you. Be careful when choosing your friends, because a good friend will always care for you. A good friend will help you succeed and steer you in the correct direction. While a lousy friend may cause trouble for you. Tips to make friends: 1. Look out for people who have similar interests and hobbies. Most friendships start because people have things in common. 2. Go out and meet them. Sometimes we get so busy with our schedules that we don't get time to meet and talk with people. So you can meet people at some group�s get-together party, etc. 3.

Here are some general guidelines for maintaining good female genital hygiene: Cleanliness: Wash the external genital area (vulva) with mild, unscented soap and warm water. Avoid using harsh soaps, douches, or perfumed products as they can disrupt the natural balance of the vagina and potentially cause irritation or infection. Remember to rinse thoroughly and pat dry with a clean towel. Proper wiping technique: When using the toilet, always wipe from front to back after urination or bowel movements. This helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anal area to the vagina, reducing the risk of urinary tract infections and other infections. Menstrual hygiene: Change sanitary pads, tampons, or menstrual cups regularly during menstruation to maintain cleanliness and prevent Odor. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper use and disposal. Avoid tight-fitting underwear and clothing: Wear breathable cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothing to allow air circulation and reduce moisture build-up, which can contribute to bacterial growth and infections. Practice safe sexual habits: If engaging in sexual activity, practice safe sex by using condoms and getting regular sexual health check-ups. It's also important to communicate openly with your partner about sexual health and any concerns. Regular check-ups: Schedule regular visits with a healthcare provider for gynaecological exams, screenings, and to address any concerns or questions you may have regarding your genital health. Remember, every individual is unique, and it's important to listen to your body and seek medical advice if you experience any unusual symptoms, discomfort, or changes in your genital area.",

If the sexual intercourse was done in the last 72 hours, then a female can take an emergency contraceptive pill. A married woman can even choose intrauterine copper T (which is effective within 5 days of unprotected sex). If it is more than 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse, then you can wait for the girl�s next period (as every sexual intercourse may not lead to pregnancy). If her next period is missed, she may need to undergo a pregnancy test. Therefore, it is always advised to use protection. There is no data available for how long before an emergency pill can be taken. However, mostly, it can be taken just before the intercourse. The least effective are natural methods. Therefore, it is always advised to avoid using natural methods, as there is a high chance of failure.�Condoms provide approximately 80% protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Condoms have a high failure rate of 12%, but if they are used properly, the failure rate can be reduced to 3%. They can fail due to slippage, breakage, etc. Don�t panic if a condom breaks or slips. You can use emergency contraception, or you can wait for the next menstrual cycle. If there is a delay in the menstrual cycle beyond 1 week, then contact a doctor for further evaluation and management.

As under the prepuce, a white colour material called smegma is deposited. Smegma is made up of dead tissues and mucin content. Smegma protects and lubricates the glans and inner lamella of the prepuce, facilitating erection, preputial eversion, and penetration during sexual intercourse. Smegma also contains lytic materials (such as lysozyme), which probably originate from the prostate, and seminal vesicles, which destroy bacterial cell walls. It also inhibits and destroys Candida species (fungal microbes). If the smegma is not cleaned, then it may harden into �smegma stones� in men, as seen with extremely poor hygienic habits. If smegma is over-cleaned (very frequently cleaned), then a person can become susceptible to a penile candida infection. Therefore, the cleaning of Smegma should be adequately done (maybe 2-3 times a week). ",

          "context": "Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin (prepuce) of the penis through a surgical procedure. It is commonly practised in certain religions, like Muslims and Jews, during early childhood. It can also be done for some medical conditions like phimosis, hypospadias, etc. Research studies show that circumcision at an early age is protective against infections, penile cancer, and phimosis, and it doesn�t affect sexual function or pleasure. However, it may have risks of surgical complications. The foreskin of the penis is non-retractable before 4-6 years of age; in certain cases, it may be up to 8�10 years. This is because the glans penis and foreskin are attached together by a layer that dissolves after a certain age. This is called physiological phimosis. Before this age, the foreskin of the penis shouldn�t be retracted, as it can cause damage or injure the penis. There is no objective data to suggest that having a physiological phimosis leads to a pathological phimosis at a later stage. In adults, the prepuce is often retracted back during peeing (urination) or while cleaning the penis (while taking a bath). No, it won�t intervene during the sexual intercourse. As during the sexual intercourse, prepuce is retracted back in an uncircumcised penis. Glans penis is the most sensitive part for the sexual stimulation. Direct stimulation over the glans penis in a fully lubricated vagina doesn�t causes pain. In adults with an uncircumcised penis, the penis should be cleaned by retracting the prepuce (over the glans) with plain, simple water. As under the prepuce, a white colour material called smegma is deposited. Smegma is made up of dead tissues and mucin content. Smegma protects and lubricates the glans and inner lamella of the prepuce, facilitating erection, preputial eversion, and penetration during sexual intercourse. Smegma also contains lytic materials (such as lysozyme), which probably originate from the prostate, and seminal vesicles, which destroy bacterial cell walls. It also inhibits and destroys Candida species (fungal microbes). If the smegma is not cleaned, then it may harden into �smegma stones� in men, as seen with extremely poor hygienic habits. If smegma is over-cleaned (very frequently cleaned), then a person can become susceptible to a penile candida infection. Therefore, the cleaning of Smegma should be adequately done (maybe 2-3 times a week). The decision to circumcise the penis is a personal and cultural choice that varies across different regions and religions. It is not universally recommended or required. Some potential benefits include improved hygiene, reduced risk of certain infections (such as urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted infections like HIV), and a lower risk of penile cancer. However, these benefits are generally modest, and the overall impact on health is relatively small. On the other hand, circumcision is a surgical procedure that carries potential risks and complications, such as bleeding, infection, pain, and damage to the penis.
